# Node.Js Vs AngularJS: Know the Difference

What is Node JS?
Node.js is a cross-platform runtime library and environment for running JavaScript applications outside the browser. This is a free and open source tool used for creating server-side JS applications.

Node.js applications are written in JavaScript. This application can runs within the Node.js runtime on Linux and Microsoft Windows. This framework offers a rich library of various JavaScript modules to simplify web development process.

What is Angular JS?
AngularJS is a structural framework for developing dynamic web apps. It allows developers to use HTML as template language and lets HTML's syntax to express application's components briefly but clearly.

It is a full-featured JavaScript framework, with the primary goal of simplification. It provides support for developing dynamic, single page web apps and supports the (MVC) programming structure.



Node JS VS. Angular JS

| Node.JS	| Angular JS | 
| --- | --- | 
| Node.js is a cross-platform run-time environment for applications written in JavaScript language.| 	AnglarJS is an open source web application development framework developed by Google.| 
| You need to install Node.js on the computer system.	| You just need to add AngularJS file just like any other JavaScript file to use it in applications.| 
| It is written in C, C++ and JavaScript languages. Node.js supports non-blocking input/output API and an event-driven architecture.	| AngularJS is written entirely in JavaScript. It also allows extending the HTML's syntax to describe the components of your application.| 
| Node.js is useful to build fast and scalable server-side networking applications.	| This framework is best suited for building single-page client-side web applications.| 
| Node.js has many different frameworks like Sails.js, Partial.js, and Express.js,.	| AngularJS is itself web application framework.| 
| It is Ideal for developing small size projects.	| It is Ideal for creating highly active and interactive web apps.| 
| Developers can use JavaScript on the client as well as the server. So they can focus on learning one language.	| Angular JS needs a deep understanding of prototyping, scope, and various other JavaScript aspects.| 
| Node.js is quite useful for generating database queries because JavaScript is used to write database queries for databases like MongoDB, CouchDB. This reduces the developer's task as they don't need to remember the syntax differences while combining Node.js and NoSQL databases.	| Almost all otjer frameworks implement MVC by asking splitting an app into MVC components. It is difficult task, but Angular makes it simple as it implements MVC by splitting the app into MVC components.| 
| Node.js will be an ideal option for the real-time collaborative drawing/editing-type apps, where the user can see the document being modify live by another user like Dropbox or Google Docs.	| Angular's declarative approach simplifies app development in a sort of WYSIWYG way. Instead of spending time on how the program flows and what loaded first the developers can define what they want, and Angular JS will take care of the dependencies.| 
| Node.js will be useful in situations when something faster and more scalable is needed.	| Angular is useful in creating real time applications like instant messaging or chat apps.| 


What Is Better Node JS Or Angular JS?
Both Node.js and AngularJS platforms are targeted at building web applications using JavaScript. However, both of them are different in their architecture and working. Node.js mainly used to build server-side applications. AngularJS is suited for building single-page client-side web applications.

These two frameworks are high performing, advanced and widely used worldwide. So one should select according to his/her project need.

Conclusion:
- Node.js is a cross-platform runtime library and environment for running JavaScript applications outside the browser.
- Node.js offers a rich library of various JavaScript modules which can simplify coding.
- AngularJS is a structural framework for developing dynamic web apps.
- The goal of Angular JS framework is to provide simplified the development process.
- Node JS is Ideal for developing small size projects while Angular JS is a great option for long size projects.
- Both Node.js and AngularJS platforms are targeted at building web applications using JavaScript. However, both of them are different in their architecture and working
